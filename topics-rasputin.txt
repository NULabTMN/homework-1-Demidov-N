and so was his request the ruler of

THE ABSOLUTE
MS RO FCZAR
CLAIMED THAT NO GREAT EU
ROPEAN COURT IS NOW UNDER
SUCH MYSTIC SWAY AS IS EM
PEROR NICHOLAS.
BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
London. July 26. The mystic pea-
sant-born Russian monk Gregory Kas
Putin, on whom a murderous attack
was made by a woman while he was
visiting hU home in a Siberian village
recently. Is described by the St. Iet
ersburflr correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle as "the absolute master of
the Russia It Is certain that no
great European court today Is under
such a mystic sway as that which
Rasputin has been reputed to have
over Emperor Nicholas of Russia and
the whole imperial household. It has
been the concern of Russia for three
years back.
The rise of Rasputin has been as
enigma to all the nobles of the court
who have not fallen under his in
fluence. His absence from St. Peters
burg', during which the attack upon
him came, was hoped to mean that he
had fallen into disgrace, but just pre
vious to the news of his being stab
bed, the announcement was made that
he had been recalled to the emperor's
palace.
This modern Richelioi?, is the son
of a fairly wealthy peasant of To
bolsk. He had but little schooling
and led an uneventful life until about
thirty years old, when he developed
religions fervor, became a lay monk
and went on a pilgrimage. At the
monasteries he visited, he picked up
some learning and also managed to
receive a letter of introduction to
Bishop Theofan at St. Petersburg.
This was In 1900. Through the in
fluence of the bishop, the peasant be
gan to meet the influential people of
the city and court. His mystic phil
osophy created interest, ami lie nad
the gift of repartee and polite con
versation. At first Rasputin stuck to his pea
sant garb, in which he made a pic
turesque figure. But soon lie took up
an elegant style of dressing and liv
ing, which excited the envy of Bish
op Theofan. Tho bishop obtained an
order to exile Rasputin to Siberia. But
not only did Rasputin's appeal to the
Tsar save him, but caused the bishop
to be dismissed to Poltowa without
even time to see his dying father.
Other powerful officials tried to
check the advance of Rasputin only
to find themselves in disfavor. Ras
putin become the intimate of Use royal
family, gave orders to the ministers
and conducted himself as the supreme
power.
Tho only successful attempt to in
duce the court to send Rasput in away
resulted disastrously for the plotters.
Before leaving, Rasputin warned the
empress that misfoioine was bure to
follow. When the heir to the throne
fell ill, the frightened empress recall
ed the favorite in haste.
Since his return. Rasputin's power
has continued to grow. His counsel
is called for in deciding every ques
tion of Importance. It is said on high
authority that he brought about t!ic
ministerial change last year that saved
Russia from a war with Australia. He
lived as a prince, with a magnificent
vilia at Yalta, in Crimea. Ore of his
daughters by his peasant wife id be
ins; educated sn an aristocratic girls'
college in St. Petersburg and is chief,
companion of the emperor's daugh

Illiterate Siberian Monk Said to be
Power Behind the Throne in Czar's
Realm.
While Rasputin was visiting his
family recently in his native town of
Krekovksy, province of Tobolsk, Si
beria, a woman named Guseva plunged
a dagger into his abdomen. She wished,
she said, to put an end to the awful
evil wrought by this man in Russia by
his impostures and intrigues under the
guise of prophet.
Rut Rasputin will recover. And when
lie does, woe to his enemies! He
blames it all on Heliodorus, abbot of
Esaritsyn, whom Rasputin, by his inlluence,
drove from the imperial court.
Rasputin will live, he declares, in spite
of Heliodorus; and he will take a terrible
reckoning.
Since the spring of this year keenest
watchers of the Russian skies have
taken a second long look at Gregori
Rasputlin. This strange, quiet personality,
unobtrusive and yet conspicuous,
used to be the target mainly for scandal
mongers and for the vast number
of Russians who are disgusted at the
character of the dominant intluence
in the czar's household. Rut recently

receptions arrangi d by his devoted followers.
The diplomats must glean
what they can from the outside, for he
does not cultivate the acquaintance oi
foreigners. None of them but would
admit that the half illiterate Siberian
peasant exercises greater sway over
the mind of the czar and his sovereign
decisions than did the austere and exalted
l'obedonostzoff, procurator of the
Holy Synod, over the stern policy of
Alexander III.
Middle sized, middle aged?he is
about 48 years old?of spare, wiry
frame, letting his light brown hair and
beard grow freely in peasant fashion,
Cregori Rasputin holds attention til
lirst sight by his remarkable nose and
eyes. His gait and his dress are those
of the devout, humble lay brother and
Scripture reader, which is the Russian
social type to which lie approximates.
Rut his large, strong, well-set nose is
that of a man of commanding will and
authority, and he has the large, bluegray
eyes of the seer who will not be
drawn into discourse on the plane of
ordinary mundane affairs.
Some men have a kind of magnetism
other than that which manifests itself
on the intellectual or spiritual side of
the personality. It may be exerted,
physically, in the form of animal magnetism,
in the "laying on of hands" to
allay nervous torture, and even in such
healing processes as osteopathy or
bone setting. The most competent objective
psychologists who have studied
Rasputin declare that he possesses this
animal magnetism to quite an amazing
degree, and that as a dynamic human
organism he is a phenomenon.
Much in Russian tradition favors the
periodic appearance of some such wizard
and soothsayer. These may be
charlatans for the most part, but now
and again they prove to be something
more. To say that the world has outgrown
them is quite erroneous as regards
Russia.

truth about Rasputin, the mysterious

Kirtland was granted exceptional
facilities for securing information:
we believe his article to be the first
really authoritative statement of the
facts published in America. It is a
story of fascinating interest a figure
out of the fourteenth century influencing
the destinies of a twentiethcentury
nation. We shall see in the
next decade a mighty conflict between
the forces of progress in Russia,
strengthened by the present war, and
the forces that in the past have been
responsible for Rasputin and the
medievalism which he represents.
The Editor.
I MISSISD having dinner with Rasputin
by one day. Every intricate
detail had at last been arranged. Although
reported to lie visiting friends
in Siberia, Rasputin had come to Petrograd,
and was to have been motored in a
closed car to a private apartment for the
dinner. Since the attempt on his life, last
spring, in one of the exclusive eating
places of fashion, ho now never appears in
a restaurant.
For six weeks I had manceuvered,
reaching for this wire and theu for that,
ill U II T l__ 1I...1 T 1 J il. _ A
uiuu iinany 1 Knew iiun i null me rigm
one?for in Russia every one ean be
readied by some wire. The point was,
to find the man whom Rasputin could not
deny, and then to find the man who could
bring pressure on that man. Fortuitously,
1 found that third man, and then I knew
that I was well ou my way to Rasputin.
And then, with the last detail completed,
1 was called away t wenty-four hours too
soon. By the space of that one day I
missed meeting the most interesting character
in Russia?the great, towering
monk, Gregory Rasputin, who from behind
the throne of Muscovy for the past
decade lias held in the mercy of his
power the dictation of the weal of the
Empire.
It is neither necessary nor discreet to
say who my acquaintance was, nor who
it was that knew Itaspntin. Emphatically
it is necessary to omit tolling the intrigue
of the pressure that was brought to
hear. But the man who knows Rasputin
1 is perhaps the only man who has ever
really known the monk intimately, and
who has ever been his confidant. He
promised to toll me, as a prelude to the
dinner, tho secret of just who Rasputin is,
and to reveal the mystery of how he arose
to his power.

A
KV sensation has come from
Russia.
Itussla has long been fur
nishing new sensations to the world,
weird happenings In mcduevnl set
tings, grotesque and grim tragedies.
While the rest of the world kept nd
Tanclng Russia stood still. While tho
Russian people, yearning for light and
liberty, have prodyced works which
constitute the pride of Russia, the
Russian autocracy, even though It had
a constitution and parliament forced
upon it, has clung to medievalism
with all Its plcturesqucness, Its qualnt
tess, Its cruelties and Its horrors.
For the third tlmo in the last few
rears the story of the death of Ras
putin has reached America. This time
It is apparently true.
The story of Gregory Rasputin is
tinlque even among the strange stories
f the monks, mystics and fortune
tellers who surrounded the Czars of
Russia and Influenced their decisions
In matters of vital Importance to the
Russian people.

text: In this connection it is interesting to quote
a remark of the Czar's concerning the monk
Rasputin, who is reported assassinated. This
monk of the Greek church has an extraordinary
influence over the czarina. His position at the im
perial court has been an. anomalous one, for he
has had no official standing; and yet he has been qL,
credited wtih enormous influence. The remark
made by the Czar about Rasputin, indicates that
the Czar is not altogether in sympathy with, the
Czarina's "inner sorrow." In explanation of his
tolerance of the monk Rasputin at court, the Czar
said: f
"Better Rasputin than hysterics every day."
This seems to indicate that the Czar thinks
that if he sent Rasputin away from court the
Czarina would make his life unbearable.
The bridge party and tea given at the W. S.
McCornick residence on Monday was one of the
most attractive and successful affairs of the kind
ever given here. One hundred and fifty were
present, and the proceeds of the entertainment
are being devoted to a relief fund for the widows
and children of French soldiers. The residence
was embellished with masses of spring flowers,
and the affair was most delightful.

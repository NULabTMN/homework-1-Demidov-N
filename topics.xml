<text>i The Pigeon=Post at
j|| By Adrlen De J;
IN France, during the siege of Paris,
at a time when the German
armies were surrounding the capital
and cutting off the Parisian
population from all communication
with the outside world, Monsieur
Rampont, the then Postmaster-General,
conceived the idea of intrusting
to pigeons the transmission of news,
thus giving the inhabitants a knowledge
of what was going on in the provinces.
In this way those members of

the Government who had remained
in Paris were put in touch with their
colleagues of the National Defense
who were at Tours. In order to attain
this subject a certain number of
pigeons were conveyed by balloon from
Paris to Tours, whence they were set
free, bearing messages photographically
reduced to microscopic dimensions
on very light collodion films. In
those days the despatch was rolled up
and inclosed in a quill attached to the
tail of the pigeon. By these means over
150,000 official and, at the lowest,
1,000,000 private messages entered
Paris.
The great French shipping company
known as the Compagnie Transatlantique
deserves the credit of making
the first attempts to establish what
may truly be styled the seapost.
On March 26,&apos; 1898, the steamship
La Champagne took aboard, for the
first time, eighty pigeons. Three
batches of birds were set free at a
6hort distance from the seaboard, and
this in most stormy weather. The
older birds safely reached their cote,
while the younger ones, unable to withstand
a pelting rain-fall, dropped into
the sea ill sight of those aboard.
On the following day, and under
Ilk infavorable wenther conditions,

<text>CARRIER PIGEONS HAVE BECOME PHOTOGRAPHERS
IDFidHANKS
NOWADAYS, since there are so
many means of sending&apos; mes
sages from one person* to an
other, pigeons, which used to have con
siderable work to do as messenger
boys, have been extremely idle and
have largely devoted themselves to
sauntering about in the air and adding
to the beauty of the landscape. But re
cently It has been found that there are
other ways of employing these birds on
Important missions besides sending
them on long distance flights as mes
senger boys. The particular new field
for pigeon activities which has been
discovered is that of photography.
These pigeon photographers were
first started on their mission in life in
Germany, where a physician had been
in the habit of sending carrier pigeons
from his office in the city to a sana
torium in the nearby country. Medicine,
pills and powders were put in a little
satchel and tied to one of the pigeons,
which carried them from the doctor&apos;s
office to the sanatorium.
At last one day a pigeon with a very
Important message was despatched
from the sanatorium to the doctor&apos;s
office, and although the bird was cele
brated for Its speed and trustworthiness
it did not appear at the end of Its
journey for a month. The same thing
later happened to another bird, and the
owners of the pigeons became very
curious to know what had become of
them. Finally it occurred to some one
that since the pigeons are able to carry
one-third of their weight it would be
possible to attach small cameras to
the birds so that when they wandered
away they would return with a record
of their wanderings on the plate of the
camera.
A special camera was made, acting
automatically, so that it would take a
picture at fixed moments. The pictures
so taken were not more than half an
inch square. For a great many years
different men experimented with these
cameras until they finally invented
something that was entirely practical.
The cameras are attached to the
breast of by straps which
pass under the wings and hold a metal
plate directly between the wings in
place. This plate has two metal hooks
on which the camera fits Â«o securely
that there is no danger of its being
dislodged even In flight.
The cameras weigh two and a half
ounces or less, and their size varies
never being more than two and a half
by two and a half by four laches. There
are many different sorts of cameras
some of which take panoramic views,
perpendicular and horizontal views and
other repeating cameras, besides the
more common single lens camera.
In order that the picture which the
pigeon is to take may be of any par
ticular place it Is necessary to know

<text>Carrier Pigeon Brings Tidings
From Far-Away Alaska.
Ben Rowland of the firm of Row
land Lucier, proprietors of the
Hoffman bar, had his attention at
tracted by a white pigeon Tuesday
morning, which had fallen exhausted
in front of his place of business. The
bird made several attempts to fly,
but was unable to make any distauce,
and Mr. Rowland easily captured it.
Upon examination he discovered it to
be a carrier pigeon and about its leg
was tied with a silk cord over a piece
of buckskin a rubber nipple. Inside
the nipple, carefully rolled in an oiled
paper, was this message, written with
pen and ink on a paper:
&quot;300 miles N. E. Dawson, Dec. 2,
1904. Bill, the old place, if note is
received O. K. come at once. Lots of
gold. Finder of this bird please noti
fy Wm. Raymond, address 2152 Mis
sion St., San Francisco, Calif. Signed:
Jim Orr.&quot;
The pigeon&apos;s leg was badly irritated
from the cord which the message was
tied on with, and the flesh had been
worn to the bone, showing that the
bird had traveled a long distance.
Mr. Rowland immediately wrote to
the party mentioned in the message,
and it is possible that a bit of history
will develop from the pigeon&apos;s visit
to Havre.
Mr. Howland had a crate built for
the bird, which has fully recovered
from the effects of its journey, and is
enjoying its new home at the HIoff
man bar.</text>

<text>GREAT BRITAIN&apos;S RULER FOND OF PIGEON RACING
Everybody knows thai King George&apos;s
horse Pintadeau ran fourth In tho Derby
two weeks ago, but how many know
that the king won a big race last week.
asks the New York Sun. V_l y tew, one
may venture to say, for it was a pigeon
race.
King George, like his father before
him, is a keen pigeon racer. Indeed,
the royal raring pigeons seem to be
more successful than the royal race
horses.
Pigeon racing is a modern pastime in
the United Kingdom, dating back hardly
more than 30 years as a properly organ
ized sport. Today there is scarcely a
town or village in the country that bam
not a lon&quot;g distance pigeon racing club
of its own. The sport is particularly
popular In the mining districts, where
the pigeon has taken the place of the
fighting bull terrier and the racing
whippet as the miners&apos; favorite.
It was about 1893 that King George
became interested in racing and breed
ing pigeons. The late King Edward
had established a small but select loft
in Sandringham before this, but It was
not until 1899 that he was successful In
one of the pigeon classics.
This was the pigeon Grand National
from Lerwick to Sandringham. The
distance was 510 miles 1,705 yards, and
King Edward&apos;s first prize winner cov
ered the distance at a rate of 1,307
yards a minute, or nearly .5 miles an
hour. King George, then duke of York,
was third with a bird that ilew 1,252
yards a minute.
The pigeon loft at Sandringham Is
built on land taken from the beautiful
deer park which fills the landscape
from west to northwest. The famous
duck pool is situated about 500 yards
in front of the loft.
From the loft a magnificent view of
the surrounding country can be ob
tained, and herds of deer roam within
a few yards of the pigeon loft.</text>

<text>How War Has Turned Pigeons Into Photographers.
Thuuuh wireless telegraphy
and aeroplanes may have les
sened the Importance of
pigeons as dispatch-bearers in times
of war, they have by no means
ousted them Only a few days since
two pigeon dealers., one of them a
German, were prrested m London
for having in their possession sixty
&quot;carrier and other pigeons&quot; in con
travention of the Aliens Restriction
Act. and about the same time a Ger
man spy was arrested in Belgium
with pigeons In his possession under
circumstances which left no room
for doubt thai they were to be
used to further his nefarious ends.
Now that armies actually can
make use of trained pigeons as pho
tographers. these birds are in the
way of becoming important factors
In war A miniature Camera Is now
manufactured for this purpose. Sus
pended by straps beneath the bird&apos;s
breast, its lens is directed downward
while the flight continues, its ac
tion is, of course, automatic, gov
erned by a turning mechanism
which causes a roll of film to be ex
posed at regular internals.
The pieoon photographer flying
abovp the enemy&apos;s lines in daytime
brings home on a tiny roll of Aim a
picture record of all that was be
neath&apos; its flight?details of the ene
my&apos;s position and strength in men
and guns
The possibilities of pigeon photog
raphy in war were recognized in
Germany some time ago. Experi
ments were made under army super
vision They were successful, views
of parks, rivers and bridges and city
streets of quite remarkable distinct
ness being developed from the ex
posed portions of fllm-rolls brought
back by the pigeon camera-carriers.
That these aerial messengers are
still capable of rendering valuable
service, chiefly between forta, Is
shown by the fact that in Germany
there are about 300,000 of these
&quot;homing pigeons,&quot; belonging to va
rious societies, and of thla number
about 8,000 aro reserved exclusively y
for Government uga.
during the Franco-German-War of
1870-71 these pigeons played a very
Important part. At first they carried
dispatches reduced by photography
to microscopic proportions on thin
sheets of paper Later, all matter,
whether public dispatches or letters,
were printed In ordinary type trans
ferred and reduced by mtcro-photog
raphy &apos;o thin films of collodion mean*
uring at?out two Inches by one.
These wore so light that thousands
of dispatches, weighing less than
one gramme, could bo carried by one
pigeon
The films were rolled up and
placed in a quill, which was then
fastened lengthwise to one of the
tail feathers. Arriving in Paris, the
ntn was flattened out, and tho
printed mutter was thrown on a
screen by lantern and copied
Later sensitive paper replaced tho
screen, so that the labor of copying
was saved The cost of sending mes
sages was high, as may be Judged
from the fact that tne postal fees
on a single dispatch would often
amount to more than $500,000. Each
dispatch was repeated, sometimes
twenty or thirty times, till acknowl
edged by balloon post, which brought
back the birds for anotner Journey.
The Gormans&apos; spared no effort to
fruBtrat these sources of informa
tion. Krhpp made special guns to
bring down (he balloons, and the
pigeons were harassed by trained
falcons.
The term &quot;carrier ptgpons&quot; for
these birds is now a misnomer, for
the &quot;carrier&quot; pigeon Is a bird of a
different type- distinguiBned by the
enormous development or the &quot;wat
tles&quot; round the eyes and beak. The
true &quot;carrier&quot; pigeon Is now more
correctly Known as the homing
pigeon, homer, or Antwerp carrier
The latter name indicates the origin
of the breed, for the Belgians are
without rivalR for their admiration
for this bird and their skill in train
ing it The home&apos; ;h even in his na
tive land, represented .by several
races, all of whtch however, possess
the &quot;homing&quot; instinct. Those races,
&quot;Les Pigeons Voyageurs,&quot; are bred
first and foremost for their powers
of flight, color and marKlng are of
no account.
The speod of some of these birds
averaged 1,250 yards a minute, but to
day this has been Increased to 1.83G
yards a minute. The speed, of course,
depends much on tho state of the
weather, In a race between Montar
giB.and Brussels, In_J876, in bright,
clear weather, all the prize-winnera
made the Journey of 270 miles in
three hours and a quarter. Over the
samo course in i$77gt; in thick, stormy
weather, thirty hours elapsed before
the first bird arrived.
Tiiat the homing pigeon possesses
an extrairdinarily acute sdnse of di
rection ti be no question. A
ease is on of a bird bought tn
Brussels and breMght over to Eng
land. where it remained in close con
finement for several months. Then,
one line day,&apos; It was liberated for ex
ercise. It at once made off, and in
a few hours was back in its toft in,
Brussels, having travelled over 400
miles of country which it had never
seen before. As a rule, however,
these birds are carefully trained, the
initial stages beginning at the age
of about four months. By the end
of the first year a flight of one hun
dred miles can be successfully per*
formed. But longer flights are per-*
formed only by fully matured \rfrds.
of at least three years old. It is a
mistake, however, to suppose, as
some do. that they will fly at night
or in a fog. They roust always have
a clear view,.</text>

From thu earliest times recorded in
history the homing pigeon&apos;s wonderful
faculty of getting home In a hurry has
been utilized In conveying messages, In
the days of the Pharoahs navigators
sailing to Egypt used to release pigeons
with messages to let tho folks know
they wero coming home. In tho seventh
century thu Arabs maintained a regular
pigeon post. Pigeons also rendered val
liable -services to tho Dutch at the slego
of Leyden In 1571.
But It took the slego of Paris during
the Franco-Prussian war forty-four
years ago to establish fully tho valuo ol
tho homing pigeon ns a messenger.
During the slego seventy-four balloons
ascended carrying pigeons to Tours and
other points. It was estimated that 800
pigeons were sent from tho provinces
to Paris during thu siege, nnd that tho
total number of messages carried by
these winged messengers would make a
library of 600 volumes. Barreswill nnd
Dagron developed a process of micro
photography by which 2.000 to 3,000
letters could be photographed on a film
two niches long nnd nn Inch and a half
wide. Tho messages were read by plac
ing them In a stereoptlcon and throwing
them on a screen. Upward of 40,000
Hii&apos;ii messages were sent during tho
siege.
So entirely successful was the pigeon
post that one of the first things&apos; Bis

was signed was to establish n pigeon

European Armies Have Developed
Birds as Bearers of Despatches
to a Remarkable Degree
By 1874 there wero military pigeon lofU
at Cologne, MeU, Strassburg and
Baden. Thu Emperor gave prizes to
eticourago the sport of pigeon racing.
Ten years&apos; after the war thero wero
no fewer than 178 private homing
pigeon societies In Germany owning a
total of 52,240 pigeons, exclusive of the
military flocks.
Evtry nation In Europe look up the
breeding nnd training of homing pigeon
for use In tlmo of war. Italy followed
next after Franco and Germany In 1876,
At the present time Italy has sixteen
military pigeon lofts. Russia has live
military pigeon lofts. Spain has a mag-
m
nlflcent military pigeon system with
eighteen lofts scattered at advantageous
points throughout tho kingdom; l&apos;or
tugal has fourteen military lofts, Aus
tria seven, Switzerland four, Sweden
and Denmark each have several, HoN
land has no military pigeon lofts, but tho
Government encourages the breeding
and training of homing pigeons, and the
fame of the Dutch pigeons Is world
wide, In Belgium, where pretty much
everybody keeps homing pigeons, Hy
ing them in races may be called the
national pastime.
During our own llttlo war with Spain
the homing pigeon rendered Important
service In carrying messages from the
blockading fleet In Cuban waters, Even
Japan has taken to breeding homing
pigeons for military use. Without
doubt some of these pigeons&apos; will see
service In tho Impending campaign In
he Shantung peninsula.
Naturally, after rendering such distin
guished services during the memorable
Siege of tho French capital, the hom
ing pigeon Is especially prized In
France. It was Inspiration rather than
forethought that placed tho pigeons nt
tho service of the Government In 1871.
At that time thero were no military pig
eons, either In Franco or elsewhere. But
some citizens of Paris by the merest
chanco had some pigeons, and It
occurred to them that they might
bo utilized. They wero offered to
tho Government and promptly nc
cepted. it was six years after
tho war beforo France set nbout the or
ganization of a military pigeon system,
Now thero are twenty-eight military
ions, cnieuy aiong wo eastern boundary.
In the vicinity of tho present conflict,
with about a hundred birds stationed nt
each, besides ten thousand In Paris.
Throughout Franco thero are a hundred
thousand homing pigeons In the hands
of private owners which tho Govern
ment Is empowered by law to com
mandecr In caso of need.
Tho breeding nnd training of tho
pigeons nro under tho care of tho En
glneer Corps. Tho utmost enre. to say
nothing of affection, Is lavished on tho
birds by tho soldiers, who become very
fond of their feathered comrades, Tho
pigeon houses nro placed facing tho
northeast, -which Is opposite tho direc

Tho averngo llock consists of about a
hundred birds, each of which receives
daily rations of an ounce and a half of

three meals, with unimited mortar, salt
sand and oyster shells to aid In digestion
As soon as they can lly, which Is when
they aro about live weckB old, their
training begins, to routlnuo throughout
their useful life, which averages about
fifteen years, Great care Is taken to

Important part in warfare. De
spito tho perfection of tho wired

V wig-wagging and other means of

has yet been invented, unless it is tho
aeroplane, that makes these means of

I While other nations of tho world,

I havo devoted years of careful study
i to the broedlng and training of horn
i 1 ing pigeons, It has only been reccnt
r ly that tho United States deemed it
necessary to look for theso winged
messengers to accompany our various
expeditionary forces to France. There
arc soveral cotes of theso swift and In
telligent birds now under Army juris
diction, and already many of theso
pigeons havo been transported across
seas. Tho best known of theso cotes
is at Lansdownc, Pa., where that well
known Philadelphia sportsman, An
thony J Drcxol Blddlc, now a Captain
In tho United States Marino Corps, is
devoting much tlmo to supervising
tho training of the birds.
Record Breakers In Flock.
In this coto are many birds that
hold records for speed and distance
flights. Charles Jones, presldont of
tho National Carrier Pigeon Associa
tion, has taken a keen Interest In tho
new army flock and turned over two
of his record breaking birds, &quot;Undo
Sam&quot; and &quot;Botty. &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;
still holds the record for an over
sea flight of 500 miles, while &quot;Betty&apos;s&quot;
600-inllo straightaway flight never
has been equalled.
It is generally conceded that tho
safest way to conceal a message to be
borno by a carrier pigeon is to en
fold It in a little tube that is tuckod
beneath tho bird&apos;s wing. Sometimes
tho noto is tied to its leg, or about
Its neck, but the tubo is moro popu
lar. When a homing pigeon is re
leased for its home flight It generally
soars to a tremendous altitude in
order to get its bearings. When It
has established its sense of direction
it darts away in straight flight to Its
goal, or cote. As tho bird flies bo
swiftly and at such a great altitude
tho chances of Its being shot by an
enemy sharpshooter Is romoto In ths
extreme and for this reason tho
chances for Its bringing homo tho

In all eases abundant ventilation

space being usually allotted to each
pair of adult pigeons and 9 eulrc
feet to each young bird. In order
to facilitate the circulation of air.
the roof of the pigeon h ns? is
never plastered, except in moun
tainous or other cold regions.
The orientation of the house is a
mat;, r of importance. Nearly all
of tit. French p aeon houses face
approximately north-11 rtheast, or in
v direction opposite to most rain
storms. The administration takes
care not to place pigeon houses
near telegraph or telephone lines,
which might injure birds, striking
them n flight. Large trees and
high buildings are also objectionable
because they afford convenient
.perches r pigeons willing to shirk
their fly nir excejses. The cages are
inelos. d in glass sashes in order to
he out rodents, and neighboring
i h mttcys are covered with wire net-
ting to prevent young pigeons from
faling into them. All of the mili
tary pigeon houses are connected
bv telephone with the offices of the
engineer corps.
As a rule, each pigetn house con
tains luo pigeons ready for mobiliza
tion. To niaintaTi this effective
force requires one or two compart- 1
ments o&apos; Lie adult pigeons, a com
partment of 2Â«gt;tÂ» young birds of the
year two detention pens (one for
each sex), which are used only at
a certain season, an infirmary facing
tile south, and a laboratory for the
reproduction of dispatches.
The denizens of a pigeon house
are selected from birds four or five
weeks old. wh&apos;ch have not hitherto
bfr their natal houses. They are
first subjt cted to four or five daysâ
observati n in order to ascertain thaâ
they are sound and to supervise
their feeding. They are then encour
_ aged to emerge from the house and
fly about by allowing them to escape
voluntarily, without frightening them,
so that they will recctgnize the en
trance door. This is done about 3 p. m.
daily. If the birds were driven out
they would probably fly far and fail
to return. When adult birds are ad
ded to the colony the preliminary
training must bo greatly prolonged.
The newcomers must first be penned
up for a considerable t me. then mat
ed with older residents, and finally
prevented from flying during the
entire season by shortening five or
six principal feathers of the left
wing by about two inches. At the
moulting season the amputated feath
ers are replaced by whole ones. By
th s time the birds have become ac
customed to their new home. The
effective or mobile corps, which in
May consists of 100 pigeons from 2
to 8 years Id is increased in Octob
er by the addition of 6 reserve
birds and 23 young birds, IS months
old. which have taken part In two
train&apos;ng campaigns. The winter col
ony. usually reduced to 130 birds by
inevitable losses, produces 200 young
for the next season&apos;s training.
The i* geo ns are fed on mixeii
&quot;â¢ans. ;**as and vetches, which have
been gathered a year. The Individ
ual daily ration consists of ab ut l&apos;a
ounces of this mixture, divided into
three meals, given at dawn, noon
and 3 m The juigeons are also
provided with clay, old mortar fine
river sand, salt and egg shells or
oyster shells, ground and mixed In
equal parts. This mixture, which is
called &quot;salted earth.â is left perman
ently in the cages.</text>

<text>On the round-topped hill at the north
end of Mare Island, the great naval sta
tion of this coast, stands a gayly-painted
little cottage, which can be seen from
any point in the great bay of San Pablo.
Inquiring strangers are surprised when
they learn that this little house is the
home of over 100 finely-bred carrier
pigeons belonging to Uncle Sam&apos;s navy,
and that the red and white stripes which
decorate the sides are for the purpose
of enabling the little messengers to
qulcfkly distinguish their home station
from a distance.
But why should the navy spend hun
dreds of dollars each year to support a
fancy breed of pigeons, the stranger
asks?
In spite of the dire prophecies of a few
malcontents it is not probable that our
fair country will see another great civil
.war, but it Is from beyond our shores
that the enemy will come, if war should
break out. In this event it will be the
duty of our navy to patrol the coast
lines of the Atlantic and Pacific, and as
the outer line of defense ward off the
invader&apos;s fleets. If, while steaming up
and down the coast one or two hundred
miles off shore, our guardian fleet should
sight the enemy, it would be of the ut
most Importance to communicate at once
with the authorities on shore. Various
inventors have claimed the discovery of
a wireless telegraph through the water,
but none has yet succeeded; to send In
a vessel with the news would weaken
the fleet in the hour of battle, but If the
fleet carries a few homing pigeons accu
rate messages may be sent in from the
ship3 to the pigeon loft, where telegraph
and telephone connections with the cities
adjacent and with headquarters at
Washington are available. Thus, the
important part that the homing pigeon
may play in the next war may be seen
at a glance.
This use of pigeons as messengers
from ships to shore Is not new, for we
have records which show that it was
practiced by the ancient Egyptians and
by the Venetians in the middle ages,
but their modern use dates from the
siege of Paris in 1871, when the Pari
sians, hemmed in on every side, used the
birds to communicate with the outer
world. After the close of that war
French military authorities used the
pigeons to communicate with the Island
of Corsica, and from this it was only a
step to sending them out on ships to
carry messages to the shore. The French
have extended this service until they
now have 4,000 birds trained for war
service In all directions.
But our own navy is always conserva
tive, and it was not until 1893 that ex
periments began on American ships. A
few officers at the Naval Academy at
Annapolis, under the lead of Prof. Henri
Marion, who had seen the. value of the
pigeon service in France, established a
loft at that place at their own expense,
and the birds were sent out on the train
ing ships and sent in from points a sea
over distances of from 100 o 250 miles.
But it remained for newspaper enter
prise to settle the question of the value
of pigeons for sea service, and in 18D4
the Petit Journal of Paris, In order to
settle a controversy with the Figaro,
chartere a steamer and sent several
thousand homing pigeons from different
parts of the European coast to sea. The
editor of the Figaro had claimed that
the pigeons would be useless 100 miles
from shore and would seassick In rough
weather, but the results of the trial
proved very different from these proph
esies. The pigeons were liberated from
the steamer in batches of several hun
dred at 90, 125, and 125 miles, and a re
markably large number, over 90 per
cent., reached their home lofts. The best
record was that of a French pigeon from
Tours, which made 465 miles In fifteen
hour3.</text>

<text>CARRIER PIGEONS.
Where They are Used, and What They
are Capable of Doing.
âThe New Popularity of the Carrier
Pigeon,â is the title of an article by George
Ethelbert Walsh, which appeared in St.
Nicholas.
Both in war and peace the carrier pigeon
has won new laurels in the past year, and
its popularity as a well-bred pet and
domestic messenger has become as great
as its usefulness as a carrier of war de
spatches where telegraph and telephone
lines are not established. That so inno
cent a creature as the dove-like carrier
should be selected for important war pur
poses, and taken into the service for fur
thering the bloody conflicts of modern
armies seems out of keeping with the
aims nf nature and an abuse of manâs
power.
The pigeon is eminently a peace-loving
bird and its nature is so different from
those of the screaming eagle and falcon
that as an emblem of war it should be a
total failure. Nevertheless the timid bird
has served armies in times of need and is
cultivated for its practical war usefulness
to an extent never dreamed of for either
the falcon, or eagle. In a sense it is the
war bird of the day.
The pigeon post at Durban, in South
Africa, was the beginning of the pigeon
experiments conducted in recent cam
paigns between the English and the Boers,
and scores of messages were carried from
one part of the English army to another
by means of the birds. Colonel ilassard
of the Royal Engineers, a staff-officer at
the Cape, had made a life study of the
carrier pigeons, and before the war broke
out he had established pigeon posts be
tween most of the btleagured cities.
From Ladysmith, Kimberly and Mafe
king, pigeons early in the sieges regularly
brought messages from the English sol
diers cooped up in the towns. Sir George
Whiteâs first message from Ladysmith whs
carried by a pigeon, and this means of
communicating with the outside world
contiuued until the number of birds in
the city was exhausted.
It was only p short time before the out
break of the war in South Africa that the
English government had decided to es
tablish a service of carrier pigeons. In
the navy, pigeon posts were recognized
means of carrying information as early as
1896, and there are over a thousand birds
recorded on the books of the royal navy.
The first naval loft was at Portsmouth
and now there are two others. In the
English army the posts have been con
fined almost exclusively to the Cape, where
the nature of the country makes the home
pigeon service of more value than in Eng
land.
The development of the war homing
pigeon service throughout Europe ha6
been more rapid than elsewhere, and army
posts support large numbers of them.
Strict laws are made to protect those in
private lofts. As a great military camp,
Europe looks upon tne carrier pigeon as a
mun tn t ho cam nt it if nAf li/.l/l /4
strict military control. In Germany, for
instance, every pigeon raised by private
breeders must be registered, and the pigeon
cann gt;t be taken out of the country or sold
without permission from the military
authorities.
In the event of a war, the German
authorities reserve the right to claim and
take possession of every carrier pigeon in
the land. In addition to this, every fort
ress and camp on German soil has its
pigeon service and over ten thousand dol
lars is appropriated annually for the sup
port of this service. There a^e upwards
of ten thousand pigeons belonging to the
war department, and every bird is care
fully trained and tested.
The United States military and naval
authorities have approved of the pigeons
as aids to the regular telegraphic means of
communication, and there are several
posts established in the We6t and along
the Atlantic coast. But on the whole this
country depends more upon private
breeders for its supply of carrier pigeons
than upon the birds already in the service
of the army or navy.
Our great distance by sea from all other
powerful nations makes it unnecessary to
arrange for the services of carrier pigeons
as the European countries have done.
There is little chance of any foreign army
invading this country and destroying the
railroad and telegraph lines connecting
the big cities. Pigeon breeding and train
ing have therefore been carried on in the
United States more in the interests of
peace and pleasure. There are hundreds
of enthusiastic owners in every state of
the Union, and probably in no country,
has the work of rearing the birds been
attended to with greater intelligence and
success.</text>

There is nothing alarming in the

At the annual session of physician

was made to new types of pneumonia
developed last winter and also to the

Request to John D. Rockefeller,

er&apos;s millions fighting disease
through the admirable Rockefeller
Institute:
Please send some of your

of fighting It, and especially of
keeping it out of the United States.
It Is known that John D. Rocke
feller&apos;s Idea, which controls his
son in the use of the Rockefeller
fortune. Is to spend money FOR
PREVENTION rather than for the
cure of individual cases. Not to
cure one or a thousand sick peo

millions in future from catching
disease that Is the Rockefeller
idea.
Investigation of this strange dis
ease In Europe, sending some of
the Rockefeller scientists, gather
ed from all over the world, Japan,
France and elsewhere, would be a
step in the line of prevention.
Later, having identified the
germ, probably one of those little
things that look like a colled

the Kaiser&apos;s blood, Mr. Rockefeller
might put up a small monument to

Ravages of Disease.
WASHINGTON, D. O. Sept. 27.
Spanish influenza, sweeping
through all but 1 of the army camps
and apparently beyond control in
many eastern communities, has caused
a tremendous increase In the death
rate of the army at home.
For the week ending Septem
ber 20. the surgeon general&apos;s of
fice reported today, the death
rate was 4.4 per cent, compared
with 23 per cent the preceding
week.
This Increase was attributed in
large measures to influenza, but the
report pointed out that the figures
do not show the seriousness of the
situation as since last Friday there
has been a farther rapid spread of
the epidemic with many deaths.
The surgeon general&apos;s office
said the epidemic may be expect
ed to sweep westward with a still
greater Increase In mortality In
the next few weeks.&apos;
Orders issued last night by pro
vost marshal general Crowder can
celling calls for entrapment of 142,
00 draft registrants between October
7 and 11 were due to the serious con
ditions in many camps and were said
by health officials to be absolutely
necessary at this time.

By Dr. Gordon Henry
THE first really serious epidemic of
disease produced by the great war
is that called &quot;the Bpaniah Influ
enza&quot; which has caused deplorable mor
tality In New York and New England.
At the outset It should be said that the
term &quot;Spanish infiuenxa&quot; Is clearly an
error, and that the name should be &quot;Ger
man Influenza,&quot; for Investigation proves
that the disease originated In the German
trenches. It has since made a tour ot the
entire civilized world, In the course ot
which It broke out with especial severity
in Spain, owing to certain local conditions.
The French, noting Its ravages in Spain,
and not having suffered very badly them
selves, gave It the title &quot;Spanish Influ-
ua&quot;
That this should be the only epidemic
disease produced by the world war Is a
remarkable proof of the protection afforded
to ns. by modern medicine and hygiene.
After nearly all other great wars, as a re
sult ot the misery, starvation and enfeeble
ment of the population, there have been
great outbreaks of pestilence, which have
depopulated cities and even countries.
The disease generally known as &quot;the
bubonic plague&quot; is the great plague which
caused the great ravages of past war
epochs, its cost in human lives has not
been less than two billions. In addition, out
breaks of smallpox, cholera, typhus and
yellow fever have followed debilitating
wars.
Fortunately our enormous progress in
medicine and our material resources for
combating disease give assurance that no
plague epidemic of such magnitude as
those ot the past can orcur in America at
the present time.
How widespread has been the outbreak
of Spanish Influenza Is shown by the fact
that our Assistant Secretary of the Navy,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, suffered from it,
while, at about the time he was recovering
the youngest son of the King of Sweden
died of it.
The first known advent of the influenza
In this country occurred when the Nor
wegian ship Bergensfjord arrived at New
York on August 12 with twenty-five cases,
three ot whom died, but there were prob
ably other sources of infection, apart from
the report that the German U-boats sur
reptitiously disseminated the Infection in
this country. Independent sources of in
fection, apparently, reached Boston and
New England, where the disease raged
most alarmingly, causing seventy deaths
in one day and 9.000 cases at the Camp
Devens military camp.
And now just what happens to the suf
ferer from Spanish Influenza? From obser
vations ot one thousand soldiers It was
found that from one to three days after
contact or approach to others who had Ibo
disease a feverish state began This fever
rose steadily until on the second or third
day afterwards, it was as high as occurs
in pneumonia. In many cases it went as
high at 104 deg. Fahr. Indeed, it is ap
parent that one of the most common as
well as the most dangerous complications
is that ot pneumonia.
The disease starts with a chill or chills
that may shake the whole room you&apos;re in
Severe headaches, with pains in the legs,
In the groin. In the neck, in the spine, and
in the small of the back are generally
present
Then &quot;that tired feeling.&quot; named by doc
tors &quot;general malaise,&quot; takes charge of the
safferer&apos;a anatomy The Ictlm feels
wretched all over Fever blisters, those
frequent accompaniments of pneumonia, of
meningitis and of tertian malaria, &quot;break
jut&quot; on the sufferer&apos;s lips.
The face becomes flushed, a thermom
eter stuck under the tongue registers 102
to 104 degroes. and the victim as well as
his doctors knows he&apos;s in for it badly.
Spanish influenza &quot;cures or kills&quot; in
Liberty motor speed. Within four days the
worst Is usually over. About the second
day the abrupt crisis takes place. On the
fourth day the patient is either as well as
he ever was, or pneumonia or another com
plication asserts its dangerous presence.
A harsh cough is a frequently encountered
2 ft
Hirshberg&apos;, A. M., M. D.
symptom. The patient thus hacks and
sprays forth lots of the microbes, which
spread the infection rapidly unlcBs handlod
with the greatest precaution.
A thick, tenacious sputum of a whitish
mucoid character distinguishes this new
disease from the well-known old influenza
with its greenish sputum. This also dis
tinguishes Spanish Influenza from pneumo
nia, with Its typical &quot;rusty colored tough
expectoration.&quot;
Failure of Intestinal action, a restricted
flow of the kidney fluids and a want of
appetite rlay a large role In the charac
teristic signs and symptoms ot Spanish
Influenza.
If you take close notice of the several
differences between this new malady and
the old influenza, you will observe that the
fever Is sharper, higher, but of shorter
duration; the total course of the new
scourge Is briefer; thero are fewer stomach
or intestinal Bymptoms in the Spanish
influenza, whereas in the previously known
influenza gastro-Intestinal disturbances
were predominant.</text>

<text>&quot;SPANISH INFLUENZA,&quot;
&quot;THREE-DAY FEVER,&quot;
AND &apos;&quot;THE FLU&quot;
History of This Disease and Va
rious Symptoms Which May
Be Noted.
UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH
SERVICE,
Rupert Blue, Surgeon General.
What is Spanish Influenza? Is it
something new? Does it come from
Spain?
The disease now occurring in this
country and called &quot;Spanish Influ
enza&quot; resembles a very contagious
kind of &quot;cold&quot; accompanied by fever,
pains in the head, eyes, ears, back or
other parts of the body, and a feeling
of severe sickness. In most of the
cases the symptoms disappear after
three or -four days the patient then
rapidly recovering; some of the pa
tients, however, develop pneumonia, or
inflammation of the ear, or menin
gitis, and many of these complicated
cases die. Whether this so-called
&quot;Spanish&quot; influenza is identical with
the epidemics of influenza of earlier,
years is not yet known.
Epidemics of influenza have visited
this country since 1647. It is interest
ing to know that this first epidemic
was brought here from Valencia,
Spain. Since that time there have
been numerous epidemics of the dis
ease. In 1889 and 1890 an epidemic
of influenza, starting somewhere in
the Orient, spread first to Russia, and
thence over practically the entire civ
ilized world. Three years later there
was anothr flare-up of the disease.
Both times the epidemic spread widely
over the United States.
Although the present epidemic Is
called &quot;Spanish influenza&quot; there is no
reason to believe that it originated in
Spain. Some writers who have stud
ied the question believe that the epi
demic came from the Orient and they
call attention to the fact that the Ger
mans mention the disease as occurring
along the eastern front in he summer
and fall of 1917.
How Can &quot;Spanish Influenza&quot; Be Rec
ognized? There is as yet no certain way in
which a single case of &quot;Spanish in
fluenza&quot; can be recognized on the
other hand, recognition is easy where
there is a group of cases. In contrast
to the outbreaks of ordinary coughs
and colds, which usually occur in thej
cold months, epidemics&quot; or mnuonza
may occur at any season of the year,
thus the present epidemic raged most
intensely in Europe in May, June, and
July. Moreover, in the case of ordi
nary colds, the .general symptoms
(fever, pain depression) are by no
means as severe or as sudden in their
onset as they are influenza. Finally,
ordinary colds do not spread through
the community so rapidly or so exten
sively as does influenza.
In most cases a person taken sick
with influenza feels sick rather sud
denly. He feels weak, has pains in
the eyes, ears, head or back, and may
bo sore all over. Many patients feel
dizzy, some vomit. Most of the pa
tients complain of feeling chilly, and

<text>DR. J. J. CLECKLEY DEAD.
Beloved Physician Succumbs to Pneumonia
Following Influenza.
All Bamberg was shocked and
grieved Thursday morning. October
17, when it was learned that Dr.-J.
J. Cleckley was dead. Dr. Cleckley
was a victim of penumonia which
followed Spanish influenza. He had
been seriously ill for only a few days,
dying at 5 o&apos;clock Thursday morning
at his home in this city.
When the epidemic of Spanish
influenza became prevalent in Bamberg,
Dr. Cleckley worked untiringly
oiiov tho cnffprino- not nnlv of his
IV/ C* l iuj CUV ?~Q v
own patients but of all who called
upon him. With one of the city&apos;s
physicians ill at that time, he was
called upon to give medical attention
to scores of cases throughout
this territory. In giving professional
attention to those suffering with the
dreaded influenza, he himself became
inoculated with the germs. Although
he was sick and weary with his practice
he did not give in to his own
sufferings until the last moment, doing
everything in his power to check
the disease in the city and surrounding
country. When he could go no
longer he went home, and the disease
made rapid progress and soon assumed
alarming proportions. The best
medical talent in this State and from
Augusta visited Dr. Cleckley, but
pronounced his case hopeless, as
pneumonia- had set in, and all that
loving, willing and anxious hands
and hearts could do availed nothing.
For two or three days before his
death, when his condition was so
serious and the end&apos; was imminent,
there was a pall of sadness throughout
Bamberg and the whole county
and territory where the practice of
this good man extended.
All that is mortal of &apos;Dr. Cleckley
was laid to rest in&apos; Sohthend cemePViHnv
aftprnnnn in the nres
ence of hundreds of sorrowing
friends and relatives. The funeral
services were conducted by the Rev.
R.&apos; H. Jones, pastor of Trinity Methodist
church, and as the remains were
lowered into the grave to mingle
again with the dust from which they
came many strong men gave vent to
their feelings at the loss the community
and the State has sustained.
The funeral services, though simple,
because of the circumstances, were
full of feeling. A most feeling prayer
was offered by Rev. Mr. Jones which
touched the hearts of all, and made
them feel anew the keenness of the
ioss, which to so many people in
Bamberg is a personal one.</text>

<text>Gregory Rasputin, one of the brightest
stars of the Russian court circles. Is the
son of a poor peasant and belongs to
the &quot;Chlysty&quot; order of austere preach
ers who flagellate their bodies and
preach privation as the only method of
expiating sins. Seven J cars ago he ob
tained the patronage of a Russian
countess, and with her aid he rose to
his present position by a very clever
ruse Complaining to the countess that
his name, Rasputin,&quot; which means
&quot;rake.&quot; was not befitting so holy a man,
he begged her to get him an audience
with the Czar to obtain permission, to
change It The audience was granted,
and so was his request the ruler of
all the Russlas ordering that he should
henceforth be known as &quot;Gregory JJovj.&quot;
Rasputin made a deep Impression upon
both the Czar and Czarina on account
of his marvelous memorj. He can re
cite whole chapters of the Bible by
heart and lnvarlajilj answers questions
addressed to him by apt quotations from
the Scriptures.
His success aroused Jealousy In the
Holy Sjnod. of which the Czar Is the
head, and a famous archbishop preach

The prelate was banished and Ras
putin s triumph was complete He now
edits a paper, for the acquisition of
which the minister of finance oted him
a special grant of 300 000 roubles.
To the astonishing feats of micro
scopical writing should be added those
of an Englishman, near Manchester,

nine words over within the space cov

feat In writing the word Easter with
a capital &quot;E&quot; 57,11 times on the back

THE ABSOLUTE
MS RO FCZAR
CLAIMED THAT NO GREAT EU
ROPEAN COURT IS NOW UNDER
SUCH MYSTIC SWAY AS IS EM
PEROR NICHOLAS.
BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
London. July 26. The mystic pea-
sant-born Russian monk Gregory Kas
Putin, on whom a murderous attack
was made by a woman while he was
visiting hU home in a Siberian village
recently. Is described by the St. Iet
ersburflr correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle as &quot;the absolute master of
the Russia It Is certain that no
great European court today Is under
such a mystic sway as that which
Rasputin has been reputed to have
over Emperor Nicholas of Russia and
the whole imperial household. It has
been the concern of Russia for three
years back.
The rise of Rasputin has been as
enigma to all the nobles of the court
who have not fallen under his in
fluence. His absence from St. Peters
burg&apos;, during which the attack upon
him came, was hoped to mean that he
had fallen into disgrace, but just pre
vious to the news of his being stab
bed, the announcement was made that
he had been recalled to the emperor&apos;s
palace.
This modern Richelioi?, is the son
of a fairly wealthy peasant of To
bolsk. He had but little schooling
and led an uneventful life until about
thirty years old, when he developed
religions fervor, became a lay monk
and went on a pilgrimage. At the
monasteries he visited, he picked up
some learning and also managed to
receive a letter of introduction to
Bishop Theofan at St. Petersburg.
This was In 1900. Through the in
fluence of the bishop, the peasant be
gan to meet the influential people of
the city and court. His mystic phil
osophy created interest, ami lie nad
the gift of repartee and polite con
versation. At first Rasputin stuck to his pea
sant garb, in which he made a pic
turesque figure. But soon lie took up
an elegant style of dressing and liv
ing, which excited the envy of Bish
op Theofan. Tho bishop obtained an
order to exile Rasputin to Siberia. But
not only did Rasputin&apos;s appeal to the
Tsar save him, but caused the bishop
to be dismissed to Poltowa without
even time to see his dying father.
Other powerful officials tried to
check the advance of Rasputin only

Tho only successful attempt to in

Before leaving, Rasputin warned the
empress that misfoioine was bure to

Since his return. Rasputin&apos;s power
has continued to grow. His counsel
is called for in deciding every ques

Realm.
While Rasputin was visiting his
family recently in his native town of
Krekovksy, province of Tobolsk, Si
beria, a woman named Guseva plunged
a dagger into his abdomen. She wished,
she said, to put an end to the awful
evil wrought by this man in Russia by
his impostures and intrigues under the
guise of prophet.
Rut Rasputin will recover. And when
lie does, woe to his enemies! He
blames it all on Heliodorus, abbot of
Esaritsyn, whom Rasputin, by his inlluence,
drove from the imperial court.
Rasputin will live, he declares, in spite
of Heliodorus; and he will take a terrible
reckoning.
Since the spring of this year keenest
watchers of the Russian skies have
taken a second long look at Gregori
Rasputlin. This strange, quiet personality,
unobtrusive and yet conspicuous,
used to be the target mainly for scandal
mongers and for the vast number
of Russians who are disgusted at the
character of the dominant intluence
in the czar&apos;s household. Rut recently

high in the councils of the empire?
who are struggling and scheming
against one another, and the ablest
members of the foreign embassies, who
are seeking to trace the motive springs
for the working of the czar&apos;s will, tind

receptions arrangi d by his devoted followers.
The diplomats must glean
what they can from the outside, for he
does not cultivate the acquaintance oi
foreigners. None of them but would
admit that the half illiterate Siberian
peasant exercises greater sway over
the mind of the czar and his sovereign
decisions than did the austere and exalted
l&apos;obedonostzoff, procurator of the
Holy Synod, over the stern policy of
Alexander III.
Middle sized, middle aged?he is
about 48 years old?of spare, wiry
frame, letting his light brown hair and
beard grow freely in peasant fashion,
Cregori Rasputin holds attention til
lirst sight by his remarkable nose and
eyes. His gait and his dress are those
of the devout, humble lay brother and
Scripture reader, which is the Russian
social type to which lie approximates.
Rut his large, strong, well-set nose is
that of a man of commanding will and
authority, and he has the large, bluegray
eyes of the seer who will not be
drawn into discourse on the plane of
ordinary mundane affairs.
Some men have a kind of magnetism
other than that which manifests itself
on the intellectual or spiritual side of
the personality. It may be exerted,
physically, in the form of animal magnetism,
in the &quot;laying on of hands&quot; to
allay nervous torture, and even in such
healing processes as osteopathy or
bone setting. The most competent objective
psychologists who have studied
Rasputin declare that he possesses this
animal magnetism to quite an amazing
degree, and that as a dynamic human
organism he is a phenomenon.
Much in Russian tradition favors the
periodic appearance of some such wizard
and soothsayer. These may be
charlatans for the most part, but now
and again they prove to be something
more. To say that the world has outgrown
them is quite erroneous as regards
Russia.</text>

left for Russia, we asked him to
find out and write for us the real
truth about Rasputin, the mysterious
monk who is said to be the power
behind the Russian throne. Mr.
Kirtland was granted exceptional
facilities for securing information:
we believe his article to be the first
really authoritative statement of the
facts published in America. It is a
story of fascinating interest a figure
out of the fourteenth century influencing
the destinies of a twentiethcentury
nation. We shall see in the
next decade a mighty conflict between
the forces of progress in Russia,
strengthened by the present war, and
the forces that in the past have been
responsible for Rasputin and the
medievalism which he represents.
The Editor.
I MISSISD having dinner with Rasputin
by one day. Every intricate
detail had at last been arranged. Although
reported to lie visiting friends
in Siberia, Rasputin had come to Petrograd,
and was to have been motored in a
closed car to a private apartment for the
dinner. Since the attempt on his life, last
spring, in one of the exclusive eating
places of fashion, ho now never appears in
a restaurant.
For six weeks I had manceuvered,
reaching for this wire and theu for that,
ill U II T l__ 1I...1 T 1 J il. _ A
uiuu iinany 1 Knew iiun i null me rigm
one?for in Russia every one ean be
readied by some wire. The point was,
to find the man whom Rasputin could not
deny, and then to find the man who could
bring pressure on that man. Fortuitously,
1 found that third man, and then I knew
that I was well ou my way to Rasputin.
And then, with the last detail completed,
1 was called away t wenty-four hours too
soon. By the space of that one day I
missed meeting the most interesting character
in Russia?the great, towering
monk, Gregory Rasputin, who from behind
the throne of Muscovy for the past
decade lias held in the mercy of his
power the dictation of the weal of the
Empire.
It is neither necessary nor discreet to
say who my acquaintance was, nor who
it was that knew Itaspntin. Emphatically
it is necessary to omit tolling the intrigue
of the pressure that was brought to
hear. But the man who knows Rasputin
1 is perhaps the only man who has ever
really known the monk intimately, and
who has ever been his confidant. He
promised to toll me, as a prelude to the
dinner, tho secret of just who Rasputin is,
and to reveal the mystery of how he arose
to his power.</text>

This is tho third time that report has

Nicholas learned of the horrors of vodka,
and Immediately set about to eliminate

When Rasputin lay wounded In Tyumen
In 1914 his Majesty sent to him the court

was then that Rasputin mudo this startling
accusation against Illlodor, &quot;the mad monk,&quot;
who Is now In Now York:
&quot;It Is all that cursed Illlodor. Hut, to
the confusion of hlmsolf and my enemies,
I will live, nnd they will have nooses put

When Interrogated, the Gusevu woman
declared that she had attempted to kill
Rasputin because ho had spread tempta
tion among the Innocent. No connection
could be established between her and
Illlodor.
SUSPECTED AS PRO-GERMAN
The attempted assassination of last
spring Is supposed to have been duo to
political causes. Rasputin had been well
autualnted with lit-neral W. A. Souk

War during the fatal campaign In East
Prussia, when traitors were believed to
have betrayed the Russian armies In the
field anil left them without reserves of

<text>In this connection it is interesting to quote
a remark of the Czar&apos;s concerning the monk
Rasputin, who is reported assassinated. This
monk of the Greek church has an extraordinary
influence over the czarina. His position at the im
perial court has been an. anomalous one, for he
has had no official standing; and yet he has been qL,
credited wtih enormous influence. The remark
made by the Czar about Rasputin, indicates that
the Czar is not altogether in sympathy with, the
Czarina&apos;s &quot;inner sorrow.&quot; In explanation of his
tolerance of the monk Rasputin at court, the Czar
said: f
&quot;Better Rasputin than hysterics every day.&quot;
This seems to indicate that the Czar thinks
that if he sent Rasputin away from court the
Czarina would make his life unbearable.
The bridge party and tea given at the W. S.
McCornick residence on Monday was one of the
most attractive and successful affairs of the kind
ever given here. One hundred and fifty were
present, and the proceeds of the entertainment
are being devoted to a relief fund for the widows
and children of French soldiers. The residence
was embellished with masses of spring flowers,
and the affair was most delightful.</text>

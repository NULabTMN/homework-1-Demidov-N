AND PNEUMONIA.
Grip ha? become epidemic in the
city, one school reports every child
as having been afflicted.
Tho disease is not confined to the
children. Grown upu are suffering
headaches, sore throats, heavy eyes
and fever.
There is nothing alarming in the
malady, except thai enp frequently
lays the foundation for pneumonia.
At the annual session of physician
in Mew York on Tuesday, reference
was made to new types of pneumonia
developed last winter and also to the
larce number of cases of the disease
in the army. An Ogden physician says
the pneumonia which has been follow
ing grip in the east is difficult to diag
nose and does not readily yield to
treatment.

WASHINGTON, D. O. Sept. 27.
Spanish influenza, sweeping
through all but 1 of the army camps

a tremendous increase In the death

For the week ending Septem

with 23 per cent the preceding

This Increase was attributed in
large measures to influenza, but the

do not show the seriousness of the
situation as since last Friday there
has been a farther rapid spread of
the epidemic with many deaths.

Into the Scandinarian Neutral Countries, Where It Has Claimed Many Lives, Seems
to Hare Been by Way of Belgium and Holland.
By Dr. Gordon Henry
THE first really serious epidemic of
disease produced by the great war
is that called "the Bpaniah Influ
enza" which has caused deplorable mor
tality In New York and New England.
At the outset It should be said that the
term "Spanish infiuenxa" Is clearly an
error, and that the name should be "Ger
man Influenza," for Investigation proves
that the disease originated In the German
trenches. It has since made a tour ot the
entire civilized world, In the course ot
which It broke out with especial severity
in Spain, owing to certain local conditions.
The French, noting Its ravages in Spain,
and not having suffered very badly them
selves, gave It the title "Spanish Influ-
ua"
That this should be the only epidemic
disease produced by the world war Is a
remarkable proof of the protection afforded
to ns. by modern medicine and hygiene.
After nearly all other great wars, as a re
sult ot the misery, starvation and enfeeble
ment of the population, there have been
great outbreaks of pestilence, which have
depopulated cities and even countries.
The disease generally known as "the
bubonic plague" is the great plague which
caused the great ravages of past war
epochs, its cost in human lives has not
been less than two billions. In addition, out
breaks of smallpox, cholera, typhus and
yellow fever have followed debilitating
wars.
Fortunately our enormous progress in
medicine and our material resources for
combating disease give assurance that no
plague epidemic of such magnitude as
those ot the past can orcur in America at
the present time.
How widespread has been the outbreak
of Spanish Influenza Is shown by the fact
that our Assistant Secretary of the Navy,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, suffered from it,
while, at about the time he was recovering
the youngest son of the King of Sweden
died of it.
The first known advent of the influenza
In this country occurred when the Nor
wegian ship Bergensfjord arrived at New
York on August 12 with twenty-five cases,
three ot whom died, but there were prob
ably other sources of infection, apart from
the report that the German U-boats sur
reptitiously disseminated the Infection in
this country. Independent sources of in
fection, apparently, reached Boston and
New England, where the disease raged
most alarmingly, causing seventy deaths
in one day and 9.000 cases at the Camp
Devens military camp.
And now just what happens to the suf
ferer from Spanish Influenza? From obser
vations ot one thousand soldiers It was
found that from one to three days after
contact or approach to others who had Ibo
disease a feverish state began This fever
rose steadily until on the second or third
day afterwards, it was as high as occurs
in pneumonia. In many cases it went as
high at 104 deg. Fahr. Indeed, it is ap
parent that one of the most common as
well as the most dangerous complications
is that ot pneumonia.

text: "SPANISH INFLUENZA,"
"THREE-DAY FEVER,"
AND '"THE FLU"
History of This Disease and Va
rious Symptoms Which May
Be Noted.
UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH
SERVICE,
Rupert Blue, Surgeon General.
What is Spanish Influenza? Is it
something new? Does it come from
Spain?
The disease now occurring in this
country and called "Spanish Influ
enza" resembles a very contagious
kind of "cold" accompanied by fever,
pains in the head, eyes, ears, back or
other parts of the body, and a feeling
of severe sickness. In most of the
cases the symptoms disappear after
three or -four days the patient then
rapidly recovering; some of the pa
tients, however, develop pneumonia, or
inflammation of the ear, or menin
gitis, and many of these complicated
cases die. Whether this so-called
"Spanish" influenza is identical with
the epidemics of influenza of earlier,
years is not yet known.
Epidemics of influenza have visited
this country since 1647. It is interest
ing to know that this first epidemic
was brought here from Valencia,
Spain. Since that time there have
been numerous epidemics of the dis
ease. In 1889 and 1890 an epidemic
of influenza, starting somewhere in
the Orient, spread first to Russia, and
thence over practically the entire civ
ilized world. Three years later there
was anothr flare-up of the disease.
Both times the epidemic spread widely
over the United States.
Although the present epidemic Is
called "Spanish influenza" there is no
reason to believe that it originated in
Spain. Some writers who have stud
ied the question believe that the epi
demic came from the Orient and they
call attention to the fact that the Ger
mans mention the disease as occurring
along the eastern front in he summer
and fall of 1917.
How Can "Spanish Influenza" Be Rec
ognized? There is as yet no certain way in
which a single case of "Spanish in
fluenza" can be recognized on the
other hand, recognition is easy where
there is a group of cases. In contrast
to the outbreaks of ordinary coughs
and colds, which usually occur in thej
cold months, epidemics" or mnuonza
may occur at any season of the year,
thus the present epidemic raged most
intensely in Europe in May, June, and
July. Moreover, in the case of ordi
nary colds, the .general symptoms
(fever, pain depression) are by no
means as severe or as sudden in their
onset as they are influenza. Finally,
ordinary colds do not spread through
the community so rapidly or so exten
sively as does influenza.
In most cases a person taken sick
with influenza feels sick rather sud
denly. He feels weak, has pains in
the eyes, ears, head or back, and may
bo sore all over. Many patients feel
dizzy, some vomit. Most of the pa
tients complain of feeling chilly, and

text: DR. J. J. CLECKLEY DEAD.
Beloved Physician Succumbs to Pneumonia
Following Influenza.
All Bamberg was shocked and
grieved Thursday morning. October
17, when it was learned that Dr.-J.
J. Cleckley was dead. Dr. Cleckley
was a victim of penumonia which
followed Spanish influenza. He had
been seriously ill for only a few days,
dying at 5 o'clock Thursday morning
at his home in this city.
When the epidemic of Spanish
influenza became prevalent in Bamberg,
Dr. Cleckley worked untiringly
oiiov tho cnffprino- not nnlv of his
IV/ C* l iuj CUV ?~Q v
own patients but of all who called
upon him. With one of the city's
physicians ill at that time, he was
called upon to give medical attention
to scores of cases throughout
this territory. In giving professional
attention to those suffering with the
dreaded influenza, he himself became
inoculated with the germs. Although
he was sick and weary with his practice
he did not give in to his own
sufferings until the last moment, doing
everything in his power to check
the disease in the city and surrounding
country. When he could go no
longer he went home, and the disease
made rapid progress and soon assumed
alarming proportions. The best
medical talent in this State and from
Augusta visited Dr. Cleckley, but
pronounced his case hopeless, as
pneumonia- had set in, and all that
loving, willing and anxious hands
and hearts could do availed nothing.
For two or three days before his
death, when his condition was so
serious and the end' was imminent,
there was a pall of sadness throughout
Bamberg and the whole county
and territory where the practice of
this good man extended.
All that is mortal of 'Dr. Cleckley
was laid to rest in' Sohthend cemePViHnv
aftprnnnn in the nres
ence of hundreds of sorrowing
friends and relatives. The funeral
services were conducted by the Rev.
R.' H. Jones, pastor of Trinity Methodist
church, and as the remains were
lowered into the grave to mingle
again with the dust from which they
came many strong men gave vent to
their feelings at the loss the community
and the State has sustained.
The funeral services, though simple,
because of the circumstances, were
full of feeling. A most feeling prayer
was offered by Rev. Mr. Jones which
touched the hearts of all, and made
them feel anew the keenness of the
ioss, which to so many people in
Bamberg is a personal one.
